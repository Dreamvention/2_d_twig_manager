Starting from Opencart 3.0.0 All themes will move to Twig templating engine. Well, we thought, why wait and added support for opencart 2.x

##Installation

2. Donwload the Archive
3. Unzip 
4. Uplaod all files into ROOT folder of your opencart installation
5. Go to Admin -> Extensions -> Modules. 
6. Click Install Twig Manager.
7. You should also have a new module visible - Event Manager (if not - you must install [Shopunity](https://shopunity.net) module and redo the process)
8. If you are running an opencart stroe below 2.3.0.0 - you will need to activate the Event Compatibility option in Event Manager -> Settings.
9. Then Go to Twig Manager -> Tab Settings and activate Twig support.


Now you can enjoy Twig template files.
